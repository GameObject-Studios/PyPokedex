# Windows 11 x86_64 build of PyPokédex by Kyle Pummell

I created this project as practice of my learning of Python programming.
Topics covered include:
    - Creating a GUI application using the Tkinter library
    - Reading from a file
    - Accessing and manipulating .CSV data
    - Displaying images using Tkinter
    - Using custom fonts in a Tkinter application
    - Updating data shown in various labels on Tkinter GUI
    - Building an executable using pyinstaller
    - Web scraping, APIs and creating images from raw text data

Sprites:
    Most of the sprites used were created from data provided by the pokebase API at https://pokeapi.co/
    The alternate forms and megas sprites were found at the sites mentioned in the credits.txt file.

Fonts:
To use the fonts provided in the 'Fonts' folder, they must be properly installed. 
In most modern Windows Operating Systems, you should be able to right-click the font file and 
    select 'Install' from the menu. For other operating systems, I found the following resources:
    For Linux: https://www.unixtutorial.org/how-to-install-ttf-fonts-in-linux/
    For Mac OS: https://support.apple.com/guide/font-book/install-and-validate-fonts-fntbk1000/mac

This build can only be expected to function properly on a Windows 11 x86_64 bit Operating System (OS)
The source code can be found at the following URL: 
    

To run: run/open the main.exe file
